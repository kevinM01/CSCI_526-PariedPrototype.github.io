Tiny Titan is a 2D platformer where the player's size changes based on collectibles, and platforms can shatter depending on the player's size. Navigate through falling rocks, collect diamonds, and reach the flag to win.

## Prototype Description
Tiny Titan requires players to navigate through falling rocks and collect diamonds. Green diamonds increase the player's size, while red diamonds reduce it. The goal is to reach the flag without falling or being crushed by rocks. If the player's size surpasses a threshold, platforms will shatter, adding to the challenge.
